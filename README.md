## Overview

This project implements an automated textile quality inspection system using YOLOv8 segmentation models. The system can detect, classify, and measure fabric defects in real-time, providing accurate quality control for textile manufacturing processes.

### Key Features

- Real-time fabric defect detection using YOLOv8 segmentation
- Calibration system for accurate dimensional measurements
- Database integration for defect tracking and analysis
- Support for multiple defect types and classifications
- Automated annotation saving for quality records

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RishWijewardhena/vision-textile-inspection.git
   cd vision-textile-inspection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   
   For Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   For Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your configuration settings (if needed).

## Usage

### Running the Calibration Tool

Before performing inspections, calibrate the system for accurate measurements:

```bash
python calibration.py
```

### Running the Main Inspection System

Start the fabric inspection application:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Database Management

Access database operations directly:

```bash
python database.py
```
